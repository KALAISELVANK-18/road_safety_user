# road_safety

The Road Safety App is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance safety on the roads by monitoring vehicle speed limits and providing emergency alerts. Built using Flutter and integrated with Firebase for real-time notifications, the app offers several key features:

1. Speed Limit Monitoring: Utilizes GPS data to track the vehicle's speed and alerts the driver when they exceed the prescribed speed limit for a given area, promoting adherence to traffic regulations.

2. Emergency Alerts: Enables users to receive immediate notifications in case of emergencies, such as accidents or road hazards, enhancing communication and response times for emergency services.

3. Fine and Billing Management: Facilitates the management of fines and billing processes, allowing users to stay informed about any penalties incurred for traffic violations.

4. Dual Dashboards: Provides separate dashboards for users and administrators, offering tailored functionalities for both parties. Users can access features like speed monitoring and emergency alerts, while admins have oversight and management capabilities.
